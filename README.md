# TypeScript

### What is Typescript?
Typescript is a superset of the JavaScript language, which provides strict typing for JS via the TS type system.

The final compiled output is pure javascript; JS engines donâ€™t know, or care about typescript. It is a development-time construct.

See: http://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html


### How does it work?
When we author our code in TS we use additional syntax(type annotations), this extra syntax informs the type system the purpose of the code. 

The TS we write in our source code is compiled down to vanilla JS.


### Why use it?
Using TS when writing our source code helps use eliminate bugs in our code, before they ship to develop. 

Typescript will assess the code, and catch any errors when writing.

TypeScript is best thought as a watchful eye over you javascript, preventing you from writing buggy code.
