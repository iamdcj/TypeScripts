// A tuple is very similar to an array in structure.
// The key difference from an array is that each member
// represents one particular property of a single record,
// whereas arrays are usually a collection of records

// Object format
const chap = { name: "David", age: 32, weight: 163 };

// Tuple format
const tuChap = ["David", 32, 163];
// Each element of the array/tuple relates to a single thing,
// in this case a person, and the ordering
// would need to be fixed when working we multiple instances.
