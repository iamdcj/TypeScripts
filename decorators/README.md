# TypeScript Decorators

### What are Decorators in TS?

They are functions that can be used to modify the properties and methods in a Class.

They aren't the same as Decorators in regular JavaScript.

They can be used inside or on a class.

The execution order is the key to understanding and appreciating them.

They are totally experimental.
