# TypeScript

Typescript is a superset of the JavaScript language, which provides strict typing for JS via the TS type system.

The final compiled output is pure JavaScript; JS engines donâ€™t know, or care about typescript; _it is a development-time construct._

### How it works

When we author our code in TS we use additional syntax: type annotations andinterfaces - this extra syntax informs the type system what we are trying to do with the code/variables we author.

### Why use it?

Using TS when writing our source code helps use eliminate bugs in our code, before they ship to develop.

Typescript will assess the code, and catch any errors when during authoring via compilation.

> it is always better to catch bugs before runtime. - A. Developer

**TypeScript is best thought as a watchful eye over our JavaScript source code.**
