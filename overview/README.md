# TypeScript

Typescript is a superset of the JavaScript language, provideing strict typing for JS via the TS type system.

Using TS when writing our source code helps engineers eliminate bugs in the code they author, before the application ships.

Typescript will assess the code, and catch any errors when during authoring via compilation.

> it is always better to catch bugs before runtime. - A. Developer

**TypeScript is best thought as a watchful eye over our JavaScript source code.**

### Mechanics of TypeSecript

When we author our code in TS we use additional syntax: [type annotations](../core/annotations) and [interfaces](../core/interface) - this extra syntax informs the type system what we are trying to do with the code/variables we author.

The final compiled output is pure JavaScript; JS engines donâ€™t know, or care about typescript; _it is a development-time construct._
